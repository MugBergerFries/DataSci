    "- You **MUST** leave all of your notebook cells **evaluated** so the graders do not need to re-evaluate them. For 100+ students, this extra time adds up, and makes the graders' lives unnecessarily more difficult.\n",

The study broke participants up into three groups of 15 participants each, where the groups would have a nap, or have a coffee, or have a coffee-nap, then perform a task where their reaction time was measured.

One of the central assumptions of linear regression is that the data are observations generated by some process, independently of one another. With time series data, we need to be careful because there could be some other process affecting the output data. In particular, **annual cycles** are patterns that reoccur each year and are frequently present in time series data. For example, seasonal patterns of weather are annual cycles.\n",

Justify your answers using your plot, **and** by computing the mean interest in data science for each month. So, compute 12 values and report them in a markdown table. Do **not** just spit out a horizontal list of 12 numbers. That would be yucky to try to read, and we're scientists.\n",
